  GIC is a kernel type Interpreter compiler.
  Witch doesn't use eny system call's at-all.
  The main goal is to make, a interpreter witch is fast in every mean,
  and that it can be flexible (that's why it is a Intrepreter).
  The project main goal of course is, that it can help Quanfoxes to make 
  cross platforming aplications mutch easier to make.
  And adding the extra fun to the team :D   .
